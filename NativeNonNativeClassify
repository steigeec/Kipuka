Here is the github:

Input file looks exactly like this:
hdim_beating_niclassify.csv
join your sequences with mine at the first step (before feature classification)
in case you decide to add your own seqs to this dataset, you'll need to be careful about aligning them
NIClassify often messes up the alignment by inserting gaps and/or cutting off the last few bp. 
definitely make sure to check the alignments that NIClassify produces
H-trainn.csv: Not all columns in this dataset will be relevant for your project (e.g. "total_reads" and "sort" are just there to help me keep my data organized). The important columns are A-C, J, N, and Q
I've included some zOTUs with unknown status because as I understand it, you're supposed to have a few unknowns in your training data. So those ones probably won't be of much use to you

Mid stage output file (after features calculation from the sequences, with known status filled in for species greater than 98% confidence):
HDIM-full3785OTUS

Final output file (with status predictions from machine learning, and a few it got wrong that I replaced):
niclassify-predictions
